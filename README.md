# LSTM-human-activity-recognition
We are going to do Human activity recognition using smartphones dataset and an LSTM RNN
Classifying the type of movement amongst six categories:
> WALKING
> WALKING_UPSTAIRS
> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
> SITTING
> STANDING
> LAYING

Data Set
Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
> Contains 3D Gyro sensor values.
> Contains 3D accelerometer sensor values.
> 7352 training series (with 50% overlap between each series).
> 2947 testing series.
> 128 time steps per series.
> 9 input parameters per time step.
